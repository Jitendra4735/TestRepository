Git is a version controlling feature.It help us to get all of the changes and commits on the project.Or we can say it track all of the 
operations which are performed on the file present on git repository.


To update github by using github:
	git clone https://github.com/git/git 

How to add files to git:

Commands				Use

git init 		: 		will create a git repository on github
git status 		: 		if we want to check what is present on the github repository.
git add "FileName	:  		This command is used to add the file on git hub repository
git commit -m "Message"	: 		This command is used to commit the changes by giving a commit message

Branches:
Whenever we start working with large projects , we are having a large changes on the project , and we want to ensure that the new changes
will not affect the previous running code, So we need to create branchings.
OR
As we begin to work with bigger project on git , what you wanna do is sometimes you want to make very large changes to your project while
at the same time you want to ensure that all your previous code(the code that you know works) is safe.So if something wrong in the code,
you will be able to revert to the previous stage.This can be achieved by git branch. We can make all of the code changes and if all works
well , add it to the master branch.

NOTE: Whenever we see * in front of branch name. It means whatever we are going to commit , is committed on that branch.

Commands		:		Use

git branch		:		Command is used to see the available branches on the github repository
git branch "branchName"	:		Used to create a branch on the github repository.
git checkout "branchName":		To change branch in which we want to work.

We can create and checkout the branch by using a single command as well.
git checkout -b "branchName"
